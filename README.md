Apache Fineract: A Platform for Microfinance [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apache/fineract.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/fineract)  [![Docker Hub](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/apache/fineract.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract)  [![Docker Build](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/apache/fineract.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract/builds)
============
Fineract is a mature platform with open APIs that provides a reliable, robust, and affordable core banking solution for financial institutions offering services to the worldâ€™s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.  

[Have a look at the FAQ on our Wiki at apache.org](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/FAQ) if this README does not answer what you are looking for.

Requirements
============
* Java >= 1.8 (Oracle JVMs have been tested)
* MySQL 5.5

You can run the required version of the database server in a container, instead of having to install it, like this:

    docker run --name mysql-5.5 -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql -d mysql:5.5

and stop and destroy it like this:

    docker rm -f mysql-5.5

Beware that this database container database keeps its state inside the container and not on the host filesystem.  It is lost when you destroy (rm) this container.  This is typically fine for development.  See [Caveats: Where to Store Data on the database container documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) re. how to make it persistant instead of ephemeral.


Instructions how to run for local development
============

Run the following commands:
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=mifosplatform-tenants`
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=mifostenant-default`
1. `./gradlew tomcatRunWAR`


Instructions to download gradle wrapper
============
The file fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar binary is checked into this projects's Git source repository,
but won't exist in your copy of the Fineract codebase if you downloaded a released source archive from apache.org.
In that case, you need to downloaded it using the commands below:

wget --no-check-certificate -P fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar

(or)

curl --insecure -L https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar > fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar

Instructions to run Apache RAT (Release Audit Tool)
============
1. Extract the archive file to your local directory.
2. Run `./gradlew rat`. A report will be generated under build/reports/rat/rat-report.txt

Instructions to build a war file
============
1. Extract the archive file to your local directory.
2. Run `./gradlew clean war` or `./gradlew build` to build deployable war file which will be created at build/libs directory.


Instructions to execute Integration tests
============
> Note that if this is the first time to access MySQL DB, then you may need to reset your password.

Run the following commands, very similarly to how [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) does:
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=mifosplatform-tenants`
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=mifostenant-default`
1. `./gradlew clean integrationTest`


Instructions to run using Docker and docker-compose
===================================================

It is possible to do a 'one-touch' installation of Fineract using docker-compose:

Prerequisites:
* docker and docker-compose installed on your machine

Installing a new Fineract instance:

* Clone the Fineract Github repository
* Run the following commands:
  * docker-compose build
  * docker-compose up -d
* Fineract will run at https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider

The [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) will build the `fineract` container from source.

https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract has a pre-built container of this project, built continously.

You can use a MySQL database from a different or remote server by passing the server's IP address to the docker finerect buid process like this:

    `docker build --build-arg mysqlserver=<MySQL server IP> -t fineract:latest .`

The run it:

    `docker run -d fineract:latest`
